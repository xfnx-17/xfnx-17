## Alternatives to Vercel Cards for Stats

If you're looking for alternatives to Vercel cards to display statistics about your project, here are some options:

### GitHub's Native Stats API
- GitHub provides an API that can be used to get insights into your repository's statistics. You can access data such as commits, issues, pull requests, and more.

### External Service Providers
- **Shields.io**: This service allows you to create nice-looking badges that display the status of various aspects of your project.
- **Badgen.net**: Similar to Shields.io, it provides services to generate badges in a lightweight manner.
- **Snyk or CodeClimate**: These services can provide you with metrics on code quality and vulnerabilities.

### Custom Solutions
- You can build your own statistics dashboard using JavaScript and libraries like Chart.js or D3.js, which pull data via GitHub's API.

With these options, you can effectively communicate project stats without relying on Vercel cards!
